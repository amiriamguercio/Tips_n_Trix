##How to subset some lines from a file from bash zipped and unzipped for testing 

#for a normal (unzipped file)
cat path/to/file/filename.txt | head -n 1000000 > newfile.txt


#for a zipped file (say a fq.gz) when I want a small zipped file in the end
zcat path/to/file/filename.fastq.gz | head -n 1000 > newfile.fastq | gzip newfile.fastq

##of course tail -n works too
